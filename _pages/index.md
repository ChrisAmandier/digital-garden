# Welcome to my digital garden! ðŸŒ±



<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  Take a look at <span style="font-weight: bold">[[Your first note]]</span> to get started on your exploration.
</p>

<p>
<strong> This is the digital garden of Chris Amandier.</strong> I'm a paranormal researcher, writer, artist, and the host of Buried Secrets Podcast. I write about paranormal and occult weirdness, history, tech, creativity, and nostalgia.
</p>

<p>
  If you want my more refined (though still ever-evolving) thoughts, check out my <a href="https://www.buriedsecretspodcast.com/listen/">podcast</a> or <a href="https://www.buriedsecretspodcast.com/tag/blog/">blog</a>. These are my notes. They're written for me, first and foremost, but I've decided to share them with the public to 1) force myself to take better, more rigorous notes and revisit them often, and 2) share what I'm learning about with fellow researchers.
</p>

<p>
  If you decide to reference any of my research, please be sure to attribute it to me.
</p>

<p>
Since these notes are written for me first and other audiences second, you can expect to find plenty of broken links to unshared notes, bits that may make sense to no one but myself, typos, and other mistakes.</p>

<p> That's all as it should beâ€”I'm here to learn in public, and I'm always evolving my thoughts and ideas.
</p>
