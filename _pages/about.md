## More about this digital garden

### My notetaking methods
As a researcher, I use the [zettlekasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) of taking notes. Essentally, zettlekasten is an atomized, non-linear notetaking style that encourages you to develop original thoughts and make novel connections. For more information, I reccomend the book [*How to Take Smart Notes* by SÃ¶nke Ahrens](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes).

I keep my personal knowledge database in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a free notetaking software that works from locally-stored markdown files, which means that your notes aren't locked into proprietary software and you can take 'em with you if you ever decide to leave. If you're looking to build a second brain, Obsidian is a great place to do that.

I've been following zettlekasten practices since September 2022, though I often find myself slacking off. 

For zettlekasten, you're supposed to put concepts into your own words and synthesize your own thoughts based on what you've read. That's the real secret sauce of zettlekasten.

But, especially when you're taking notes on the fly, it's easy to just paste a quote of what you're reading into your notes and move on. It's better than just *not* making a note of what you've read, but it prevents your notes from being as useful as they could be.

That's where this digital garden comes in. 

My goal is to have a regular (weekly or weekly-ish) workflow of revising and refining notes, and then uploading them into this digital garden. I want this to be an impetus for me to clean up my notes and stop being lazy.

### Technical information
If you're considering making your own digital garden, it's very easy to do. This digital garden was created using this template [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll). I followed the instructions in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg-9n_A4Tf0) to set it up. It took me under an hour and was free. (This is hosted on github, so I'm not even paying a hosting fee subscription.) You don't need to know how to code to do it.
