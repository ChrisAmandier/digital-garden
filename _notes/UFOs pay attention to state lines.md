In _Operation Trojan Horse_, John Keel talks about how a lot of UFO flaps happen within the borders of a particular state. For example, he gives the example of a flap in Arkansas, where on August 16, 1966, hundreds of people reported seeing UFOs. However, there were no reports from Oklahoma, Mississippi, Tennessee, or Louisiana for that day, which suggests that whoever is visiting is aware of the borders that are drawn on our maps. That’s interesting, because it potentially dispels the idea that we are being visited by entities who know nothing about our world, or don’t know much about our world I want to learn more. Instead, the idea is that whoever is visiting, knows our maps well enough to only appear in certain areas and to respect those boundaries, for whatever mysterious reason they might have.
