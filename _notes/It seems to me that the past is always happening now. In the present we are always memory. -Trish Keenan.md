Love this [[quote]]. Also I love [[Broadcast band]], or at least the album [[The Noise Made By People by Broadcast]]. I never listened to any others. But it seems like I should. Maybe especially [[Broadcast and The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age album]], because that seems most relevant to the stuff I'm looking at with [[electronic music, psychogeography, and nostalgia]] and paranormal [[nostalgia]]. Sounds like there's a lot of weird stuff in there, occult references, etc.

Found it in [[Chapter 21 Stone Tapes-Ghost Box, Nostalgia, and Postwar Britain by David Pattie]]
