[[Simon Reynolds]] quote about [[Ghost Box record label]] and the twisted, eerie [[nostalgia]] of it all

[[hearing musical samples from the 70s that are transformed into something nostalgic and strange]]

[[unheimlich]] [[hauntology]] 

> Ghost Box’s “memory work” isn’t exactly therapeutic, though, a salve for homesickness (the root meaning of nostalgia). Their music is too disorienting for that kind of simple comfort. What is returned to you (assuming, perhaps, that you’re British and grew up in the 1960s and 1970s) is a sense of this country as a stranger, more fantastical place than you had ever realized: Homeland becomes _unheimlich_.
