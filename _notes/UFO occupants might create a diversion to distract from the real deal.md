[[John Keel]] writes about how UFO occupants might create a diversion to distract from the real deal.

So you might stage "diversionary landings" and "seemingly important incidents" near an area where much wilder, real activity is happening. He says "The diversion wins all our attention and publicity and the important activity goes unnocticed."

This came up in [[John Keel's Anomaly newsletter]] , [Anomaly issue 1, May 1, 1969](https://archive.org/details/Anomaly_01_1969_May). 

He then goes on to argue that [[UFOs are environmental phenomenon rather than ETs]]
