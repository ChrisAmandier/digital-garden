They're tall, hot, and rich; they sound like [[Lord of the Rings]] elves. Humans can only see them if the elves want them to.

They live inside boulders and hills. DO NOT touch the grass of the hillocks they live in.

They appear to people in [[dreams]] if they want something. (Often they need the help of midwives.) If you help them, you're rewarded. If not, you're fucked. 

There're many stories of humans being raised in the elf realm and returning to the human world and being successful. Interesting contrast to many [[changeling]] stories.

[[Icelandic Folk Legends by Alda Sigmundsdottir]]:
> They are variously called álfar (elves) or huldufólk (hidden people) but basically they are the same type of being.
