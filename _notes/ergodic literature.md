Texts that are weird to read.

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_literature#:~:text=Ergodic%20literature%20is%20a%20term,reader%20to%20traverse%20the%20text.) definition: "literature in which nontrivial effort is required for the reader to traverse the text"

Definition from [its only dark](https://itsonlydark.substack.com/p/unspace-unchapters), where I learned the term: “books where the text formatting is sometimes all weird.”
