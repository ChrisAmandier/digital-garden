For [[ESP]] testing, it's important to give immediate feedback to tap into people's ability to learn and improve. Slow feedback could actually reduce someone's ESP abilities (since it's an [extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_(psychology)) method.)

[[Learning to Use Extrasensory Perception by Charles Tart]]:
> Almost all learning takes place in situations where the  correct response is rewarded on each trial and incorrect responses  are not rewarded, or may even be punished.
> 
> ... Almost all studies of learning  show that learning is slower and less effective as the interval between  response and reward increases. With lower organisms, particularly,  a fairly lengthy interval between response and reward results in no  learning at all, i.e., the organism never emits the correct response  with greater than chance frequency. In general, intervals between  response and reward or feedback are optimal if they are of less than  a second, and learning falls off rapidly in many instances if these  intervals reach even a few seconds.
