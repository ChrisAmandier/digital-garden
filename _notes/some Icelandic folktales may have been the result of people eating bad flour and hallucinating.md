This is just a theory from [[Alda Sigmundsdottir]], but she questions whether some more outlandish folktales could have been related to imported flour that had gone bad. Could this apply to [[folklore]] and [[fairy tale]]s from other places as well?

This recalls the theory about the [[Salem witch trial]]s being influenced by [[ergot]], or a hallucinogenic [[mold]] that made people believe that [[witchcraft]] was occuring.

According to [[Icelandic Folk Legends by Alda Sigmundsdottir]]:
> Some of them may also seem disjointed and strange – particularly the story “Þorgeir’s Bull,” which can only be described as extraordinarily weird. I have even wondered sometimes if the people who made up that story were on something. I mentioned this to my husband, who told me that reports exist about rotten flour or meal having been imported to Iceland, and when people ate it, they started hallucinating. I can’t help but think that this might apply to that story.
