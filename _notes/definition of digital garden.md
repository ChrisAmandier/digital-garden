This is a great definition of a digital garden, from [Joel Hooks' blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). It's all about the craft and process of creating and [[learning in public]]. 
> The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.
