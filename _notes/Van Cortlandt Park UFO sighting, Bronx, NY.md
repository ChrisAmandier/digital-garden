Love this [[1950s]] ufo sighting in [[van cortlandt park]]. Classic flying saucer vibes.

From [[Passport to Magonia by Jacques Vallee]]:
> Nov. 5, 1957 0430
> In Van Cortland Park, Frank C. was talking with a bus driver when they saw in the park, about 400 m away, a metallic object shaped like a disk, spinning with a soft whirring. On top was a fixed dome with portholes. The object was hovering at tree-height, A yellow light from the craft suddenly illuminated the area, and it flew off "like a shooting star."
