natical elements in her work:
- reef-like dashed white lines (1907 paintings)
- made an inventory of lighthouses (1906)
- cartographic symbols in The Ten Largest
- nautical maps are about depicting invisible things (underwater, inaccessible landscapes), just like her art

[[Hilma af Klint by Julia Voss]]:
> In 1906, the same period when she began work on the cycle Paintings for the Temple, she made an extensive inventory of lighthouses around the world. The nautical influence can also be seen in her paintings, above all in The Ten Largest, where cartographic symbols like those used by her forefathers appear.
