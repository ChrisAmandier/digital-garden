[[hauntology]] apparently is also the name of a [[music]] genre, which I had no idea about. It appears to be a 2000s [[United Kingdom]] [[electronic music]] genre. 

It draws from:
- British culture from the 1940s-70s
- stock music ("library music")
- film/tv soundtracks
- PSAs

Seems like it has ties to [[Mark Fisher]] and [[Burial musician]]

[More info on wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauntology_(music)), which also talks about how it ifnluenced a genre called [[hypnogogic pop]], which also feels real paranormal. Also influenced [[chillwave]]
