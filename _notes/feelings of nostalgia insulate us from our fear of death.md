Feelings of nostalgia insulate us from our fear of death; study info below.

That means that if we're feeling nostalgic while, say, ghost hunting, it can help us stay grounded.

> Â researchers measured trait nostalgia (frequency and importance of nostalgia), induced existential threat via MS, and then assessed the extent to which participants had a sense of meaning in life. Whereas thinking about death resulted in a lower sense of meaning, this effect was not found among participants who were highly nostalgic. Two additional studies assessed the extent to which inducing nostalgia resulted in lower levels of death-thought accessibility after MS. Consistent with research showing that engagement of terror management structures reduces heightened accessibility of death-related thought following death reminders (Arndt, Cook, & Routledge, 2004), Routledge, Arndt, Sedikides, and Wildschut (2008) showed that the effect of MS on elevated death-thought accessibility was lower among nostalgia-prone participants (Study 2) and among participants subjected to an experimental induction of nostalgia (Study 3). In sum, after MS, nostalgia kept levels of death-thought accessibility low and perceptions of meaning high.
