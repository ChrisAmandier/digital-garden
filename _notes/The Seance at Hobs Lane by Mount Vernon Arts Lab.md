*[The SÃ©ance at Hobs Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_S%C3%A9ance_at_Hobs_Lane)* by Mount Vernon Arts Lab is an album published by [[Ghost Box record label]]. 

It's an unofficial soundtrack of a 1950s BBC series called [*Quartermass and the Pitt*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatermass_and_the_Pit) which apparently inspired Stephen King and John Carpenter. The series involves people investigating psychic aliens who'd abducted early humans and given them psychic powers, leaving some humans with heightened psychic powers. Apparently it melds alien/UFO stuff with witchcraft and ghosts. Hammer made[ a 1967 film version.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatermass_and_the_Pit_(film))

Listening to it right now. So far, I really like the tracks "Hobgoblins," "The Black Drop"
