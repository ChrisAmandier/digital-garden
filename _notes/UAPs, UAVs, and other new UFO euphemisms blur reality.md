In a March 3, 2022, talk that he gave for the [[Archives of the Impossible]], [[Jacques Vallee]] talks about how when science fails, they come up with language to cover up their failure. He says that these new abbreviations for UFOs are just ways to blur the physical and psychological reality of different people's experiences of ufos. He says that the categories aren't quite broad enough to cover those sorts of things people have seen, leaving us with fewer words to describe our own experiences.

He calls it a "subtle linguistic displacement." He also says it "unfairly biases future research."
