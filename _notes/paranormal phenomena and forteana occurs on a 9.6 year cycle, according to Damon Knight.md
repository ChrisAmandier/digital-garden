In the late 60s, Damon Knight indexed all of Charles Fort's reported phenomena and claimed that the data happened on a 9.6-year cycle. For example, from 1877-1892, there were peaks in 1877, 1883, 1889, and 1892. This is detailed in his book *Charles Fort: Prophet of the Unexplained*.

There also seems to be a correlation between Mars' movements and paranormal phenomena.

[[in 1966, UFO sightings happened more often on the 10th of the month and the 21st-24th]]
