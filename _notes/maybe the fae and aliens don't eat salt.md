This is interesting because of the stories about [[ghosts]] and evil spirits being banished or deterred by salt.

from [[Passport to Magonia by Jacques Vallee]]:
> It is interesting that the analysis performed for the Air Force did not mention the presence of salt in the pancakes given to Simonton. Indeed, Wentz was told by an Irishman who was quite familiar with the Gentry that "they never taste anything salt, but eat fresh meat and drink pure water." Pure water is what the saucer men took from Simonton.
