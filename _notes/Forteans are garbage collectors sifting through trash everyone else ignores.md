In this episode of [[Tracing Owls]], Vuk talks about how Forteans are garbage collectors sifting through trash everyone else ignores.

This also links up with the idea of damned facts, the things that everyone else throws away, which have such a wealth of information.

this part of the convo's maybe 53 mins in?
