mentioned by [someone on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatewaytapes/comments/13iijkj/focus_10_question/) as something to listen to in conjunction with the [[Gateway Tapes and Experience]]. Sounds like they're similar to [[binaural beats]]. They can be [used for chakra alignment](https://solfeggioguide.com/solfeggio-frequency-guide/). They appear in [[Gregorian chants]], apparently.
