Just read [this great substack (from it's only dark)](https://itsonlydark.substack.com/p/unspace-unchapters) about *The Raw Shark Texts* by Steven Hall, a book I haven't heard of but which plays with [[liminal]] spaces and [[surreal]] imagery. Has the vibe of [[House of Leaves]]. Both are examples of [[ergodic literature]].

The substack talks about how there are unchapters associated with the book, negatives of the chapters that the book contains that add to the story and which have evaded a lot of people searching for 'em.

Sounds like I need [[to read]] this book.
