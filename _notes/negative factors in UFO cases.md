This came up in [[John Keel's Anomaly newsletter]] , [Anomaly issue 1, May 1, 1969](https://archive.org/details/Anomaly_01_1969_May). 

[[John Keel]] says that "negative factors" often crop up in [[UFO]] cases, ever since 1897.

Those might include commonplace things like:
- newspapers
- pieces of metal
- ordinary pieces of clothing
- ordinary chemicals
- normal tire tracks (found in inaccessible fields)
- [[UFO occupants often use Ancient Greek words]]
- [[UFO occupants might create a diversion to distract from the real deal]]

They trick people into thinking that the landing is a [[hoax]], but Keel says that negative factors are actually indications that "a real UFO event did occur."

He then argues that [[UFOs are environmental phenomenon rather than ETs]]

Elsewhere, he says that [[the UFOnauts are liars and hoaxers, not the contactees]]
