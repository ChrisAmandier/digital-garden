In [[John Keel's Anomaly newsletter]] , [Anomaly issue 1, May 1, 1969](https://archive.org/details/Anomaly_01_1969_May), [[John Keel]] says that some UFO contact cases are [[induced hallucinations]], or hallucinations caused by an external source (similar to [[hypnosis]]).

Also, [[some men in black may be hallucinatory]]

from the newsletter:
> HALLUCINATORY EFFECTS. UFO believers usually rebel at any suggestion that the phenomenon may be hallucinatory or psychological. However, in the past three years many psychological factors have been discovered and various groups of psychologists and psychiatrists are now actively engaged in UFO re- search. Unfortunately very few ufologists ara trained or equipped to understand or even to invest- igate the underlying psychological factors. You should read at least one good book on psychiatry and/or psychology.
> 
> At least some of the "contact" cases investigated in the past three years have proven to be hallucinatory. We have termed these "induced hallucinations" because it seems that the effects were produced in the witnesses' minds by an exterior influence. These effects are similar to hyonosis. While the witnesses' bodies undergo one sequence of experiences, false memories (confabulation) of another sequence of experiences are planted in their minds.
> 
> Frequently the true (but "forgotten") experience surfaces from the witness subconscious later on in the form of a dream or nightmare. le can not outline the whole process here but it must be considered as a very important factor in many cases. Never even hint of this when interviewing such a witness. Do not attempt to analyse such cases yourself. Simply extract all of the remembered details from the witness and include them in your report. These reports will be correlated and studied by qualified psychiatrists.
> 
> If we make the mistake of discussing these factors publicly on radio, TV, etc., many witnesses will refuse to submit to interviews because they will fear that we think they're "crazy". So the hallucinatory factor must remain a ufological secret until we have built a body of medical evidence to support and explain it.
> 
> It is now probable that some UFO sightings are not of real objects but are actually a variation of this hallucinatory effect. The method and purpose of this effect is now known to a select handfull of competent researchers.
