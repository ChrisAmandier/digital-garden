in [[Icelandic folklore]], [[ghost]]s tend to be unpleasant. 

They cannot hear the name of God (Guð), so you can use that to protect yourself. In [[Icelandic Folk Legends by Alda Sigmundsdottir]], she says you should "Just ask them politely if they could say “Guð” for you – if they can’t then they are probably a ghost."

[[Iceland]]ic ghosts lose their power over time, so if you can get rid of them, you can just wait for them to get weak. (Example: "Þorgeir’s Bull")
