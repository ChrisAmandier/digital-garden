This story, which includes "mock suns" and "wheels" of light or "orbs" sounds an awful lot like religious [[UFO]] experiences described by [[John Keel]] ([[Operation Trojan Horse by John Keel]]) and [[Jacques Vallee]] ([[Passport to Magonia by Jacques Vallee]]).

And the painting ended up influencing [[Hilma af Klint]]'s work, which has man wheel-like floating images.

[[Hilma af Klint by Julia Voss]]:
> The painting depicts a miracle that happened in Stockholm the morning of April 20, 1535. It shows the old town with the cathedral in the center, surrounded by the archipelago, the islands still wooded (see plate 6). The sky fills half the canvas, dwarfing the church and the houses, towers, and fortifications around it. Multiple suns appear in the sky, each surrounded by a gleaming halo.
> At the time it happened, residents of Stockholm interpreted the phenomenon as a sign from God: a heavenly greeting to followers of the new Lutheran faith. There is eyewitness testimony that suddenly multiple golden rings sparkled in the sky over the city; a Protestant reformer commissioned the painting to document the event.5 From an astrophysical perspective, the formation of such “mock suns” occurs when light is refracted by ice crystals in the atmosphere. The scientific perspective prevailed in what came to be the modern title of the work, the Mock Sun Painting. It is worth noting that a number of Hilma’s paintings after 1907 include large orbs suggestive of mock suns, which roll like huge wheels across the canvas (see plate 7).
