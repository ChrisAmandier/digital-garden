This reminds me of my own "abduction" dream experience, in which people were given eggs to eat. It disturbed me so much that the next day I woke up and never ate eggs again.

from [[A Trojan Feast-The Food and Drink Offerings of Aliens, Faeries, and Sasquatch by Joshua Cutchin]], abductees given eggs or pills:

> Orlando Jorge Feraudi claimed in an Argentinian newspaper that he had been taken by a very tall, pale entity in 1965 when he was just 18 years old. During Ferraudi’s time he was given five “eggs,” all of varying color, which he ate together with another abductee, a girl six years his junior. None of the eggs seemed to have any taste, and the pair washed the meal down with a clear, thick liquid. The fact that the eggs shared attributes with the Jane Murphy case (multi-colored) and were accompanied by a drink strongly suggests that these were in fact pills.
