It's very cool and seems like it has some interesting potential applications for [[Paranormal Investigation]] and [[parapsychology]] [[experiment]]s. Real [[estes method]] vibes.

Made something: chant.codes
Will randomly display visual noise, random English words, while also speaking the words. I wanted to make something that resembles the feeling of staring into TV static 'snow'. Something like a spirit box channeling messages from the chaos.
Seems to work best in Safari (and not at all in mobile perhaps?)
CW: flickering lights and haven't completely vetted the dictionary so may there be unsavory words.
