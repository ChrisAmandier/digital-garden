According to [[Icelandic Folk Legends by Alda Sigmundsdottir]], in [[Icelandic folklore]], [[troll]]s and [[ogre]]s are:
- large
- live in mountains or caves
- aren't very smart
- can be dangerous (because their size and lack of awaresness. tho they're easy to outsmart)
- they're cannibals
- they like the taste of human flesh
- the scariest one is [[Gryla]]

There are two types of trolls:
1) ones who can go out during both night and day
2) ones who can only go out at night and turn to stone when the sun comes out (stone pillars are said to be petrified trolls)
