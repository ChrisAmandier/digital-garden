she never married and her biographer describes her as having two great loves in her life (both women)

There's a great 1919 [[quote]] from her about love: "two individuals must travel together, for the path makes it impossible for one person to proceed alone."

[[Hilma af Klint by Julia Voss]]:
> there were two great loves in her life—the artist Anna Cassel and the nurse Thomasine Anderson. Without these women, the story told here would have been unthinkable. Without love, af Klint was convinced, there could be no insight. To achieve wisdom, she wrote in December 1919, “two individuals must travel together, for the path makes it impossible for one person to proceed alone.”
