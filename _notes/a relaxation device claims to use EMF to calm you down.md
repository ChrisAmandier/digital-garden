[this skeptical video](https://youtu.be/caVoqAfdkYQ) talks about a supposed relaxation device that you wear on your head and it emits EMF frequencies and can either help you calm down or help you focus. Somewhere fiest 10 mins of the video, though I didn't get the time stamp. Seems kind of scammy, though what do I know.
