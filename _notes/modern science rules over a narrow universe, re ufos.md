I love this [[quote]]: "Modern science rules over a narrow universe, one particular variation on an infinite theme."

Because science really does have hard limits and it sucks that so many people will only accept the world that is espoused by modern science, even though we clearly don't know everything, and science has been wrong before in the past.

> if they are not real, should we see these rumors as a sign that something in human imagination has changed, bringing into a new light uncharted areas of our "collective unconscious"? They may be only children of our fancy, and our love for them akin to our love for Batman and Cinderella. But they may be real. Modern science rules over a narrow universe, one particular variation on an infinite theme.
