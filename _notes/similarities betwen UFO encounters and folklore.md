[[UFO]] encounters feel almost like [[dreams]], nightmares, or [[fantasy]] stories and [[fairy tale]] happenings.


from [[Passport to Magonia by Jacques Vallee]], re: [[Betty and Barney Hill]]:

> Of considerable interest to the psychologist is the fact that the entities are endowed with the same fugitiveness and behave with the same ignorance of logical or physical laws as the reflection of a dream, the monsters of our nightmares, the unpredictable witches of our childhood. Yet their craft do leave deep indentations in the ground, according to observers who were fully awake and absolutely competent at the time of the sighting.
