If a subject is confident about their answer, that's generally weighed more heavily in [[parapsychology]] research. Reminds me of [[remote viewing]] studies and how [[Uri Geller]] would sometimes pass on tests if he didn't feel confident about them.

from [[Learning to Use Extrasensory Perception by Charles Tart]]:
> Initially each subject guessed at targets in three standard closed decks of Zener cards (five each of five symbols), and also indicated  when he felt particularly confident about the correctness of a call.  Such "confidence calls" have often been evaluated separately from  total calls in parapsychological research and are frequently associated with a higher hitting rate.
> ... In all three studies, there was a significant increase in the  proportion of correct confidence calls, so subjects were learning  something about the internal feelings that go with correct ESP  performance. Further, in the first and third studies, the feedback  group showed significant ESP hitting on their total scores as well as  significant increases on their confidence calls following the feedback condition, even though their scoring had not differed significantly from chance before the training. Note also that, as would  be expected from the learning theory application, subjects in  the false feedback group showed a tendency, although it was not  statistically significant, to make lower overall ESP scores and a  lower proportion of correct confidence calls after the false feedback  condition.
