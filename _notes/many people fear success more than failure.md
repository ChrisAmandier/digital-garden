I'm definitely guilty of [[fear of success]]. This also makes me think of [[The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron]], which talks about [[self-sabotage]] that artists carry out when at the brink of success.

Also, [[you need people who can talk you out of your bs doubts and self-sabotage]]

From [the article](https://stackingthebricks.com/fear-of-success/):
> On the surface, “fear of success” sounds like it makes NO sense at all, but it typically tracks to a feeling of **“well shit, if this works I’m on the hook.”** ...
> 
> There are many factors that lead to success and failure. Neither are 100% predictable.
>
> However, 100% of the people who achieve a tiny level of success and then stop, do not succeed.
>
> If this is a pattern you recognize in yourself, and changing it is within your control.
