I really enjoyed this episode of The Invisible night school that had Jayson Shenk as a guest. It talks about the connections between art and creativity and the paranormal and unexplained. In particular, there's a bit where they talk about how art and creativity is like dowsing. It's kind of powered by the same thing.

It's about [57 mins into the video](https://www.youtube.com/live/f78IRxqA8FU?feature=share)
