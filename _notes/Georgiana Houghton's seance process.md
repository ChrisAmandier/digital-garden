started with single letters then moved on to art

from [[Hilma af Klint by Julia Voss]]:
> During the s√©ance, Houghton and her mother sat at a table. They laid their hands on the surface and waited with paper and pen every day, for three months. The first messages that came were single letters of the alphabet. In less than two years, Houghton began to draw as a medium.
