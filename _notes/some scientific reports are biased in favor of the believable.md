Science doesn't always tell us the truth. It's important to understand that bias is possible anywhere.

from [[Passport to Magonia by Jacques Vallee]]:
> Just as some cheap magazines are deliberately written to generate fear in the public and to capitalize on that fear, some scientific reports arc deliberate hoaxes designed to reinforce the credibility of our scientific, political, or military establishments. This is a fact of life, and it should not discourage one from the study of science. It does not necessarily mean that anybody is hiding some formidable truth. If the idea that science knows nothing about certain phenomena is unacceptable to the public, why should it he more easily acceptable to professional scientists?
