After an encounter with a glowing being during which he is temporarily paralyzed, a man comes down with a [[fever]]. 

from [[Passport to Magonia by Jacques Vallee]]:
> Six days later, on October 20, 1954, in Parravicino d'Erba, near Como, Italy, a man had just put his car in the garage when he saw a strange being, covered with a luminous suit, about four feet tall, standing near a tree. When he saw the motorist, the creature aimed a beam from some sort of flashlight at him, paralyzing the witness until a motion he made when clenching the fist holding the garage keys seemed to free him. He rushed to attack the stranger, who rose from the ground and fled with a soft whirring sound. The author of this unbelievable story was thirty-seven years old and was known locally as a trustworthy man. He arrived home in a state of great shock and went to bed with a high fever. The details of the case were obtained through an investigation by the Italian police.
