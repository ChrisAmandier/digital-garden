We withdraw to private spaces to feel safe, as [Maggie Appleton writes](https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web). 

I believe this [Ribbon Farm issue](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe) is where [[cozy web]] (or cozyweb or cozynet) was coined:

> Unlike the main public internet, which runs on the (human) protocol of “users” clicking on links on public pages/apps maintained by “publishers”, the cozyweb works on the (human) protocol of everybody cutting-and-pasting bits of text, images, URLs, and screenshots across live streams. Much of this content is poorly addressable, poorly searchable, and very vulnerable to bitrot. It lives in a high-gatekeeping slum-like space comprising slacks, messaging apps, private groups, storage services like dropbox, and of course, email.
> ... The cozynet is not the same as [waldenponding](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/against-waldenponding-ii), since it remains connected and online and isn’t concerned about distraction or overuse of digital media. It just retreats from public view/activity for various reasons ranging from simple preference for privacy and small communities to fear and PTSD.
