The Gentry fae are the good faeries, apparently.

This makes me think of [[Allan Kardec's Orders of Spirits]]

from [[Passport to Magonia by Jacques Vallee]]:
> Before we study this abundant material, however, we should supply some background information about the mysterious folks the Irish call the Gentry, and the Scots, the Good People (Skagfr Maith):
> 
> The Gentry are a fine large race who live out on the sea and in the mountains, and they are all very good neighbors. The bad ones are not the Gentry at all, are the fallen angels and they live in the woods and the sea, says one of Wentz's informers.

later there's more info:
> Wentz then asked for a description of the Gentry, and was told the following:
>
> The folk are the grandest I have ever seen. They are far superior to us and that is why they call themselves the Gentry. They are not a working-class, but a military-aristocratic class, tall and noble-appearing. They are a distinct race between our race and that of spirits, as they have told me. Their qualifications are tremendous: "We could cut off half the human race, but would not," they said, "for we are expecting salvation." And I knew a man three or four years ago whom they struck down with paralysis. Their sight is so penetrating that I think they could see through the earth. They have a silvery voice, quick and sweet.
>
> The Gentry live inside the mountains in beautiful castles, and there are a good many branches of them in other countries, and especially in Ireland. Some live in the Wicklow Mountains near Dublin. Like armies they have their stations and move from one to another. My guide and informer said to me once, "I command a regiment, Mr. ."
>
> They travel greatly, and they can appear in Paris, Marseilles, Naples, Genoa, Turin or Dublin, like ordinary people, and even in crowds. They love especially Spain, Southern France, and the South of Europe.
>
> The Gentry take a great interest in the affairs of men and they always stand for justice and right. Sometimes they fight among themselves. They take young and intelligent people who are interesting. They take the whole body and soul, transmuting the body to a body like their own.
>
> I asked them once if they ever died and they said, No; "we are always kept young, Mr. ." Once they take you and you taste food in their palace you cannot come back. They never taste anything salt, but eat fresh meat and drink pure water. They marry and have children. And one of them could marry a good and pure mortal.
> 
> They are able to appear in different forms. One once appeared to me and seemed only four feet high, and stoutly built. He said, "I am bigger than I appear to you now. We can make the old young, the big small, the small big."

later:
> In undertaking research into beliefs in fairies, Gentry—call them what you will—confusion arises from the great variety of names and classifications given the different races of beings. In Lower Brittany alone, Paul Sebillot has found and classified fifty different names given to lutins and konigans, while latins themselves are the same as the elvish people: pixies in Cornwall, robin good-fellows in England, gohlim in Wales, goublins in NorimmrfV, "nd brownies in Scotland.

interesting that the Gentry live inside castles; makes me think of fae connections at [[Loveland Castle, or Chateau Laroche]] and generally alien connections with [[Loveland frogman]] in [[Loveland, Ohio]]
