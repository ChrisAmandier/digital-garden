[This article](https://phys.org/news/2023-05-distinguish.html) talks about a study showing that despite not having nerves, plants can detect touch.

> In a set of experiments, individual plant cells responded to the touch of a very fine glass rod by sending slow waves of calcium signals to other plant cells, and when that [pressure](https://phys.org/tags/pressure/) was released, they sent much more rapid waves. While scientists have known that [plants](https://phys.org/tags/plants/) can respond to touch, this study shows that plant cells send different signals when touch is initiated and ended.

> Previous research has shown that when a pest like a caterpillar bites a plant leaf, it can initiate the plant's defensive responses such as the release of chemicals that make leaves less tasty or even toxic to the pest. An earlier study also revealed that brushing a plant triggers calcium waves that activate different genes.
