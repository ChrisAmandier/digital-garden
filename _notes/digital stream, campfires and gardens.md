A 2018 post about digital gardens by [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/). 

This talks about the concept of [[the digital garden vs. the digital stream]] and introduces the idea of the digital campfire. Critchlow says that this is primarily blogging for him, but could also be a private [[Slack]] group (or, I assume, [[Discord]]). 

He says that [[digital campfires]], which sound like the [[cozy web]] to me:
> slower burn but fade relatively quickly over the timeframe of years. Connection forming, thinking out loud, self referencing and connection forming. This builds muscle, helps me articulate my thinking and is the connective tissue between ideas, people and more.
