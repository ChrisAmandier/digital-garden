When asked about the flap, Thomas Edison said that it was fake. He said that the technology was not there, but he seemed to think that people were seeing large balloons.

From [[Operation Trojan Horse by John Keel]]:
> “You can take it from me that it is a pure fake,” Edison declared on April 22, 1897. “I have no doubt that airships will be successfully constructed in the near future but…it is absolutely impossible to imagine that a man could construct a successful airship and keep the matter a secret. When I was young, we used to construct big colored paper balloons, inflate them with gas, and they would float about for days. I guess someone has been up to that fine game out west."
