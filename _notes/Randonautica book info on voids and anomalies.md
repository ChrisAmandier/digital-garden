I just took a look at the randonautica book to refresh my memory on what the different types mean, and I guess blind spots are "places outside your normal conscious awareness," and this is what it says about attractors and voids:


>ATTRACTORS AND VOIDS 
The second way you can impact how you interact with the app is by 
selecting whether you want an attractor point or a void point. To 
understand what those are, let’s talk a little bit about the location 
points that Randonautica generates. 
Randonautica uses a special algorithm to generate random points all across your set radius. Some of the points end up close together in 
a dense area (attractors) and some are spread out (voids). We refer to 
these areas as “anomalies.” Anomalies are things that deviate from 
what is typical, standard, or expected. To understand this on the scale 
of real life, anomalies are events that are beyond coincidental and 
make you take a step back, almost dumbfounded as to how they could 
have occurred. In math, an anomaly is something that deviates to the 
point where scientists might say something like “Wait a sec, that 
shouldn’t be there.” This is the particular thing that Randonautica 
looks for in its two sources of anomalies. 
Attractors, points in the dense area, are often described as loca- 
tions of “high energy,” but that’s not necessarily the case. Under- 
standing how randomness operates and also how an attractor can be 
found requires some imagination. Think of a 5-foot-long, 5-inch- 
diam-eter clear PVC pipe. The PVC pipe is standing upright and will 
act as the “tunnel” in this scenario. Poking through holes along the 
pipe are hundreds of tubes, like the small tubes at the dentist office 
that suck the spit out of your mouth. These tubes are blowing air at 
different forces and unpredictable intervals. This creates a tunnel of 
inconsistent airflow patterns. Now, let’s say a large handful of salt 
gets poured into the pipe from the top of the tunnel opening. The salt 
will travel down the tunnel, being stirred and unpredictably disrupted 
by the blow tubes, and will ultimately land within the 5-inch circle at 
the bottom. When the tunnel is removed, there is a 5-inch circle of salt 
that remains.
Now imagine looking at this circle of salt, how scattered and incon- 
sistent it should be—patternless, a mess. What the mathematical 
computation that derives an attractor does is look for the anomaly in 
the salt. It says, “Whoa, wait, there is a mound of salt here! This 
shouldn’t have happened. It should be chaotically distributed.” Alter- 
nate to the attractor is the void. It’s where the algorithm finds the least 
amount of salt. “Well, look what we have here, a segment with no salt 
at all!” 
To relate this back to how the Randonautica app operates, the salt 
granules represent the coordinates, the tunnel is the generator, and 
the air is creating the entropy, or randomness. The Randonautica se- 
cret algorithm, known as the Newton Library, is assessing your circle, 
set as the radius on your map, and looking for the weirdest, most 
statistically improbable way the “salt” overlaid itself. Essentially, the 
app goes through an intricate mathematical process to get your pin- 
point on your GPS. It’s a mysterious-yet-scientific way of finding loca- 
tions that are hopefully ultra-special in some way to you and the area 
around you. 
You select within the app whether you want to go to an attractor 
point or a void point. Which one you choose is totally up to you. Here 
are some general thoughts about each one:
• Some people think that void spots are more eerie and airy 
and really have the feeling of being void of energy. There 
have been reports of voids having a higher despair rate or 
an uneasy feeling. But then other people say that they like 
voids for all sorts of positive reasons. 
• Attractor points, on the other hand, have been known to 
have a denser feeling and bring Randonauts to places with 
lots of things to observe. 
These observations could all be confirmation bias, of course, as 
the words “attractor” and “void” have strong connotations. Regard- 
less, they are two different types of trips, and you can experiment for 
yourself with the effect of each type on your Randonauting adventures.
