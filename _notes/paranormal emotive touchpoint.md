This is:
- somewhere where the veil is thinner, like a soft spot
- when you feel a strong emotion, it can create one, and someone else can come there and experience and investigate that
- you can feel these soft spots because when you go there, you feel odd emotions (nostalgia, deja vu, liminality). That can be an indicator that you're at that spot.
- it can be created in group events, like a bunch of people watching a weird movie screening

Amanda Paulson came up with this.

Can this be connected to the emotions you might feel during the [[derive]]?

I wonder if this is like my experiences at the [[hellgate as a paranormal emotive touchpoint]]
