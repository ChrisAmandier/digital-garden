[[Ghost Box records uses radical nostalgia to critique the past]]. This makes me think of some of the work being done by publications like [[Hellebore Magazine]], delving into [[British folk horror]] and reexamining elements of the past.

The abstract:
> This chapter discusses the work of a small British record label, Ghost Box, whose output is set in a fictionalized version of the United Kingdom between 1945 and 1979. The label’s output has been described (by Simon Reynolds, among others) as hauntological, that is, as music creating a fictional, ghostly version of the past. This chapter argues that the virtual Britain created in the music released on Ghost Box is, in fact, a faithful representation not of the historical reality of the postwar UK but of the cultural assumptions and fears that shaped the period. The chapter discusses Ghost Box’s work as an example of radical nostalgia, as an investigation and critique of the cultural attitudes of the past, rather than a celebration of them.
