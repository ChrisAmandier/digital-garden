Per [[John Keel]], people think that contactees are lying, but they aren't. The ufonauts are.

from [[Operation Trojan Horse blog post]]
> No, the real truth lies in another direction. The contactees from 1897 on have been telling us what they were told by the ufonauts. The ufonauts are the liars, not the contactees. And they are lying deliberately as part of the bewildering smoke-screen that they have established to cover their real origin, purpose, and motivation.
 Whatever the UFOs are up to, they are doing it on a very large scale all over the earth, and it is inevitable that they should come into contact with some of us from time to time, either accidentally or by design. When such contacts do occur, they deliberately hand out ridiculous false information. They exploit our beliefs and hide safely behind the limited credulity of our scientists and governments. It is time that we got wise to this simple psychological trick. Theyâ€™ve been pulling it on us for centuries.
