Here're a few silly explanations for fairy rings. There's also one that gives an electric hypothesis that makes me think of various [[electromagnetic]] paranormal claims.

from [[Passport to Magonia by Jacques Vallee]]:
> It is amusing to note that attempts have been made, in the early days of Rationalism, to explain fairy rings as electrical phenomena, a consequence of atmospheric effects. P. Marranzino,11 for example, quotes a little couplet by Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of the English naturalist, written in 1789:
>
>> So from the dark clouds the playful lightning springs, Rives the firm oak or prints the fairy rings.
>
> And according to Erasmus Darwin:
>
>> There is a phenomenon, supposed to be electric, which is not yet accounted for; I mean the fairy rings, as they are called, so often seen on the grass.
