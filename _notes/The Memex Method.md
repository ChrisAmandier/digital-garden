I read [a great Cory Doctorow article](https://doctorow.medium.com/the-memex-method-238c71f2fb46) in which he talks about the memex method, which is basically similar to using a zettelkasten, but instead of keeping it private, it's all public. The concept is very similar, where you're trying to get yourself to keep thinking and making connections and it becomes repository of different ideas you've had an articles you've read that then can be repurposed later on. I would like to try this method. I could maybe even pair it with my daily art, to help keep myself accountable.
