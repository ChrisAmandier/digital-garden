[[John Lennon]] experienced an apport in a [[hotel]] room

He'd already seen a [[UFO]]

He encountered [[bug]]like creatures who mentally restrained him from attacking them.

Then he woke up and found that he held a [[bronze]] [[egg]]like object in his hand.

He gave it to [[Uri Geller]] later on, saying he thought it could be a ticket to another planet and he doesn't want it.
