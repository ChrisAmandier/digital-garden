Maybe that's why [[Hilma af Klint considered St. George her alter ego]]? 

She started receiving messages from higher powers in 1891


[[Hilma af Klint by Julia Voss]]:
> The sculpture of Saint George in the cathedral made a great impression on Hilma and would later figure importantly in her paintings and texts (see plates 34 and 35). The knight with the pale, gentle face would become the artist’s alter ego. When did she first sense the connection? When did she discover that George could help her to better understand herself and the uncommon gifts she possessed?
> ... Many years later she would tell her nephew: “I am so small, I am so insignificant but the force that flows through me is so powerful that I must go forward.”3 The words could just as well have been spoken by Saint George.
