[This](https://www.exostudies.org/resources/books/) looks like a great [[Reading]] list of [[UFO]] [[books]].  It's arranged by topic, which is awesome. (Worth noting: There's at least one pretty questionable author--Icke--on the list. As with all things, best to be a filter and not a sponge.)

There's also a list of 650 books; it's a downloadable file on that page.
