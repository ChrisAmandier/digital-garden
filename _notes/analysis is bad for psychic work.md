according to [[Limitless Mind by Russell Targ]], raw, uninterpreted imagery is what you want from a remote viewer. that will help you get the most accurate info. That's also why drawing things is helpful.  

The viewer should report spontaneous impressions. Interviewers should ask things like "what are you feeling?" or "what are you experiencing now" since their impressions/naked experience are on target but analysis is usually wrong. 

"Memory, analysis, and imagination are the enemies of psychic functioning."
