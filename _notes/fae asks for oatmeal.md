A woman comes to a poor man's house, probably during a famine, and asks for [[oatmeal]]. He agrees, though it's a hardship, and she says she'll come back for it. She doesn't, but the oatmeal multiplies overnight (I assume to reqard him.)

This makes me think of the [[pancake from a flying saucer]] and [[buckwheat and the fae]]. This makes me think of stories about generosity and [[hospitality]] in the [[Bible]] as well.

from [[Passport to Magonia by Jacques Vallee]]:
> In 1909, an American, Wentz, who wrote a thesis on Celtic traditions in Brittany, devoted much time to the gathering of folk tales about supernatural beings, their habits, their contacts with men, and their food.1 In his book he gives the story of Pat Feeney, an Irishman of whom we know only that "he was well-off before the hard times," meaning perhaps the famine of 1846-1847. One day a little woman came to his house and asked for some oatmeal.
>
> Paddy had so little that he was ashamed to offer it, so he offered her some potatoes instead, but she wanted oatmeal, and then he gave her all that he had. She told him to place it back in the bin till she should return for it. This he did, and the next morning the bin was overflowing with oatmeal. The woman was one of the Gentry.

> It is unfortunate that Paddy did not save this valuable evidence for the benefit of the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (Food and Drug Lab.). Perhaps they would have explained this miracle of the multiplication of the oatmeal, along with other peculiar properties of fairy food; for it is well known in Ireland that if you are taken away by the fairies, you must never taste food in their palace. Otherwise, you never come back; you become one of them.
