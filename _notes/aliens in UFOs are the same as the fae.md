[[Jacques Vallee]] argues that the fae and aliens are the same thing.

I love this [[quote]]: "we are prying into the affairs of the Secret Commonwealth."

from [[Passport to Magonia by Jacques Vallee]]:
> For the time being, let me simply state again my basic contention: the modern, global belief in flying saucers and their occupants is identical to an earlier belief in the fairy-faith. The entities described as the pilots of the craft arc indistinguishable from the elves, sylphs, and lutins of the Middle Ages. Through the observations of unidentified flying objects, we arc concerned with an agency our ancestors knew well and regarded with terror: we are prying into the affairs of the Secret Commonwealth.
